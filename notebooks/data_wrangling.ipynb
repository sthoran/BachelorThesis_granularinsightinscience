         "Recent studies suggest that glucocorticoid receptor (GR) activation can cause enzalutamide resistance in advanced prostate cancer (PCa) via functional bypass of androgen receptor (AR) signaling. However, the specific molecular mechanism(s) driving this process remain unknown. We have previously reported that the transcription factor TBX2 is over-expressed in castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). In this study, using human PCa and CRPC cell line models, we demonstrate that TBX2 downregulates AR and upregulates GR through direct transcriptional regulation. TBX2 also activated the GR via TBX2-GR protein-protein interactions. Together, TBX2-driven repression of AR and activation of GR resulted in enzalutamide resistance. Our laboratory findings are supported by clinical samples, which show a similar and consistent pattern of transcriptional activity among TBX2, AR and GR across patient cohorts. Notably, we report that SP2509, an allosteric inhibitor of the demethylase-independent function of LSD1 (a TBX2-interacting protein in the COREST complex) disrupts both TBX2-LSD1 and TBX2-GR protein-protein interactions, revealing a unique mode of SP2509 action in CRPC. Taken together, our study identifies the TBX2-driven AR- to GR- signaling switch as a molecular mechanism underlying enzalutamide resistance and provides key insights into a potential therapeutic approach for targeting this switch by disrupting TBX2-GR and TBX2-LSD1 protein-protein interactions.",

         "Aircraft trajectory prediction is vital for ensuring safe and efficient air travel while addressing challenges in complex and dynamic environments. Current trajectory prediction models often struggle in noisy scenarios due to their lack of robustness. This study introduces the Noise-Robust Autoregressive Transformer, a novel model that enhances prediction reliability by integrating noise-regularized embeddings within a multi-head attention equipped with hybrid positional encoding. This model effectively captures essential temporal-spatial relationships and manages positional information more precisely across varied trajectories. Moreover, we formulate the robust trajectory prediction problem as an autoregressive approach that models the encoding of historical data and the decoding of future positions as a sequence-to-sequence learning problem. Our approach effectively captures positional encodings for the complex spatial-temporal variations in aircraft trajectory prediction, improving long-term prediction accuracy while achieving real-time responsiveness. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate our improvement over existing aircraft trajectory prediction methods.",

Traditional risk models, primarily based on established risk factors, often lack the precision needed to accurately predict new-onset major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). This study aimed to improve prediction and risk stratification by integrating traditional risk factors with biochemical and metabolomic biomarkers., Methods, We analyzed data from 229,352 participants in the UK Biobank (median age 58.0 years; 45.4% male) who were free of baseline MACE. Biomarker selection was conducted using area under the curve (AUC), minimal joint mutual information maximization (JMIM), and correlation analyses, while Cox proportional hazards models were employed to evaluate the predictive performance of combined traditional risk factors and biomarkers. Optimal binary thresholds were determined utilizing CatBoost and SHAP, leading to the calculation of a Biomarker Risk Score (BRS) for each participant. Multivariable Cox models were conducted to assess the associations of each concerned biomarker and BRS with new-onset endpoints., Results, The combination of PANEL + All Biochemistry + Cor0.95 of Nonov Met predictors demonstrated significantly improved discriminative performance compared to traditional models, such as Age + Sex and ASCVD, across all endpoints. Although the prediction for hemorrhagic stroke was suboptimal (C-index = 0.699), C-index values for other outcomes surpassed 0.75, with the highest value (0.822) recorded for CVD-related mortality. Key predictors of new-onset MACE included cystatin C, HbA1c, GlycA, and GGT, while IGF-1 and DHA exhibited potential protective effects. The BRS stratified individuals into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups, with the strongest effect observed for CVD death, where the high-risk group had a relative risk of 2.76 (95% CI 2.48–3.07) compared to the low-risk group., Conclusion, Integrating traditional risk factors and biomarkers improves prediction and risk stratification of new-onset MACE. The BRS shows promise as a tool for identifying high-risk individuals, with the potential to support personalized CVD prevention and management strategies., Graphical abstract, ",

         "With rapid advances of deep neural networks over the past decade, artificial intelligence (AI) systems are now commonplace in many applications in biomedicine. These systems often achieve high predictive accuracy in clinical studies, and increasingly in clinical practice. Yet, despite their commonly high predictive accuracy, the trustworthiness of AI systems needs to be questioned when it comes to decision-making that affects the well-being of patients or the fairness towards patients or other stakeholders affected by AI-based decisions. To address this, the field of explainable artificial intelligence, or XAI for short, has emerged, seeking to provide means by which AI-based decisions can be explained to experts, users, or other stakeholders. While it is commonly claimed that explanations of artificial intelligence (AI) establish the trustworthiness of AI-based decisions, it remains unclear what traits of explanations cause them to foster trustworthiness. Building on historical cases of scientific explanation in medicine, we here propagate our perspective that, in order to foster trustworthiness, explanations in biomedical AI should meet the criteria of being scientific explanations. To further undermine our approach, we discuss its relation to the concepts of causality and randomized intervention. In our perspective, we combine aspects from the three disciplines of biomedicine, machine learning, and philosophy. From this interdisciplinary angle, we shed light on how the explanation and trustworthiness of artificial intelligence relate to the concepts of causality and robustness. To connect our perspective with AI research practice, we review recent cases of AI-based studies in pathology and, finally, provide guidelines on how to connect AI in biomedicine with scientific explanation.",

         "Recent studies suggest that glucocorticoid receptor (GR) activation can cause enzalutamide resistance in advanced prostate cancer (PCa) via functional bypass of androgen receptor (AR) signaling. However, the specific molecular mechanism(s) driving this process remain unknown. We have previously reported that the transcription factor TBX2 is over-expressed in castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). In this study, using human PCa and CRPC cell line models, we demonstrate that TBX2 downregulates AR and upregulates GR through direct transcriptional regulation. TBX2 also activated the GR via TBX2-GR protein-protein interactions. Together, TBX2-driven repression of AR and activation of GR resulted in enzalutamide resistance. Our laboratory findings are supported by clinical samples, which show a similar and consistent pattern of transcriptional activity among TBX2, AR and GR across patient cohorts. Notably, we report that SP2509, an allosteric inhibitor of the demethylase-independent function of LSD1 (a TBX2-interacting protein in the COREST complex) disrupts both TBX2-LSD1 and TBX2-GR protein-protein interactions, revealing a unique mode of SP2509 action in CRPC. Taken together, our study identifies the TBX2-driven AR- to GR- signaling switch as a molecular mechanism underlying enzalutamide resistance and provides key insights into a potential therapeutic approach for targeting this switch by disrupting TBX2-GR and TBX2-LSD1 protein-protein interactions.",

         "Recent studies suggest that glucocorticoid receptor (GR) activation can cause enzalutamide resistance in advanced prostate cancer (PCa) via functional bypass of androgen receptor (AR) signaling. However, the specific molecular mechanism(s) driving this process remain unknown. We have previously reported that the transcription factor TBX2 is over-expressed in castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). In this study, using human PCa and CRPC cell line models, we demonstrate that TBX2 downregulates AR and upregulates GR through direct transcriptional regulation. TBX2 also activated the GR via TBX2-GR protein-protein interactions. Together, TBX2-driven repression of AR and activation of GR resulted in enzalutamide resistance. Our laboratory findings are supported by clinical samples, which show a similar and consistent pattern of transcriptional activity among TBX2, AR and GR across patient cohorts. Notably, we report that SP2509, an allosteric inhibitor of the demethylase-independent function of LSD1 (a TBX2-interacting protein in the COREST complex) disrupts both TBX2-LSD1 and TBX2-GR protein-protein interactions, revealing a unique mode of SP2509 action in CRPC. Taken together, our study identifies the TBX2-driven AR- to GR- signaling switch as a molecular mechanism underlying enzalutamide resistance and provides key insights into a potential therapeutic approach for targeting this switch by disrupting TBX2-GR and TBX2-LSD1 protein-protein interactions.",

         "Introduction, Individual case reports are essential to identify and assess previously unknown adverse effects of medicines. On these reports, information on adverse events (AEs) and drugs are encoded in hierarchical terminologies. Encoding differences may hinder the retrieval and analysis of clinically related reports relevant to a topic of interest. Recent studies have explored the use of data-driven semantic vector representations to support analysis of pharmacovigilance data., Objective, This study aims to evaluate the stability and clinical relatedness of vigiVec, a semantic vector representation for codes of AEs and drugs., Methods, vigiVec is a published adaptation to pharmacovigilance of the publicly available Word2Vec model, applied to structured data instead of free text. It provides vector representations for MedDRA^® Preferred Terms and WHODrug Global active ingredients, learned from reporting patterns in VigiBase, the WHO global database of adverse event reports for medicines and vaccines. For this study, a 20-dimensional Skip-gram architecture with window size 250 was used. Our evaluation focused on nearest neighbors identified by the cosine similarity of vigiVec vector representations. Clinical relatedness was measured through term intruder detection, whereby a medical doctor was tasked to identify a randomly selected term—the intruder—included among the four nearest neighbors to a specific AE or drug. Stability was measured as the average overlap in the ten nearest neighbors for each AE or drug, in repeated fittings of vigiVec., Results, Among the ten nearest neighbors, 1.8 AEs on average belonged to the same MedDRA High Level Term (HLT; e.g., coagulopathies), and 1.3 drugs belonged to the same Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical level 3 (ATC-3; e.g., opioids). In the intruder detection task, when neighbors and intruders were both chosen from the same HLT, the intruder detection rate was 46%. When selected from different HLTs, it was 79%. By random chance, we should expect 20% (1 in 5). Corresponding rates for drugs were 42% in same ATC-3 and 65% in different ATC-3. The stability of nearest neighbors was 80% for AEs and 64% for drugs., Conclusion, Nearest neighbors identified with vigiVec are stable and show high level of clinical relatedness. They are often from different parts of the existing hierarchies and complement these.",

         "Localized prostate cancer (PCa) is highly variable in their response to therapies. Although a fraction of this heterogeneity can be explained by clinical factors or genomic and transcriptomic profiling, the proteomic-based profiling of aggressive PCa remains poorly understood. Here, we profiled the genome, transcriptome, proteome and phosphoproteome of 145 cases of localized PCa in Chinese patients. Proteome-based stratification of localized PCa revealed three subtypes with distinct molecular features: immune subgroup, arachidonic acid metabolic subgroup and sialic acid metabolic subgroup with highest biochemical recurrence (BCR) rates. Further, we nominated NANS protein, a key enzyme in sialic acid synthesis as a potential prognostic biomarker for aggressive PCa and validated in two independent cohorts. Finally, taking advantage of cell-derived orthotopic transplanted mouse models, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and immunofluorescence analysis, we revealed that targeting NANS can reverse the immunosuppressive microenvironment through restricting the sialoglycan-sialic acid-recognizing immunoglobulin superfamily lectin (Siglec) axis, thereby inhibiting tumor growth of PCa. In sum, we integrate multi-omic data to refine molecular subtyping of localized PCa, and identify NANS as a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic option for aggressive PCa., Prostate cancer is heterogenous in response to therapy.

In this work, we explored two different strategies for reducing AR/AR-V7/c-Myc. MED12 knockdown decreased the protein expression of AR, AR-V7 and c-Myc.

         "Background, Prior studies have elucidated that alterations in gut microbiota are associated with a spectrum of tumors and metabolic disorders. However, the diagnostic value of gut microbiota in epithelial ovarian cancer remains insufficiently investigated., Methods, A total of 34 patients with a diagnosis of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), 15 patients with benign ovarian tumors (TB), and 30 healthy volunteers (NOR) were enrolled in this study. Fecal samples were collected, followed by sequencing of the V3–V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. The clinical data and pathological characteristics were comprehensively recorded for further analysis, PICRUSt2 was utilized to conduct an analysis of microbial functional predictions, WGCNA networks were constructed by integrating microbiome and clinical data. LEfSe analysis was employed to identify microbial diagnostic markers, LASSO and SVM analyses were used to screen microbial diagnostic markers in conjunction with the Cally index, to establish a Microbial-Cally diagnostic model. Bootstrap resampling was utilized for the internal validation of the model, whereas the Hosmer–Lemeshow test and decision curve analysis (DCA) were employed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the model. Plasma samples were subjected to untargeted metabolomics profiling, followed by differential analysis to identify key metabolites that are significantly altered in epithelial ovarian cancer. At the same time, Spearman correlation analysis was used to study the association between key microbiota and differential metabolites. The supernatants from Escherichia coli and Bifidobacterium cultures were co-cultured with SKOV3 cells. Cell proliferation, migration, and invasion were evaluated using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, Transwell migration and invasion assays. Apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry analysis of fluorescence signals from Annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) staining., Results, Compared to Nor and TB populations, individuals diagnosed with EOC demonstrated a significantly diminished gut microbiota diversity when contrasted with both normal controls and those presenting benign conditions. Specifically, the relative abundance of Bilophila , Bifidobacterium , and other probiotics was significantly reduced in patients diagnosed with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), while Escherichia and Shigella demonstrated a marked enrichment within this cohort. Differential microorganisms were identified through the application of machine learning techniques to delineate the characteristic microbial profiles associated with the EOC patients. A significant correlation was identified between the Cally index and microorganisms. In conclusion, we utilized microbial biomarkers alongside the Cally to establish a diagnostic model for epithelial ovarian cancer, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve Area Under Curve (AUC) of 0.976 (95%CI 0.943–1.00), The AUC obtained from the Bootstrap internal validation was 0.974. The Hosmer–Lemeshow test revealed a robust concordance between the observed probabilities and the predicted probabilities generated by the model. The decision curve analysis revealed that the model provided a significant net clinical benefit. A total of 233 differential metabolites were identified between the EOC group and the NT (NOR and TB) groups. Among these, eight specific metabolites (HMDB0243492, C09265, HMDB0242046, HMDB0240606, C04171, HMDB0060557, HMDB0252797, and C21412) were exclusively derived from the microbiome. Notably, metabolite HMDB0240606 exhibited a significant positive correlation with Escherichia coli and Shigella , while it showed a significant negative correlation with Ruminococcus . In vitro studies demonstrated that Bifidobacterium possessed anti-tumor activity, whereas Escherichia coli exhibited pro-tumor activity., Conclusion, This study provides the inaugural comprehensive analysis of gut microbiota composition and its differential profiles among patients with epithelial ovarian cancer, those with benign ovarian tumors, and healthy controls in Hunan province, China.",

This study investigates BPA-induced liver damage and explores the mechanistic dose-dependent protective effects of P-coumaric acid (PCA). 50 male rats were divided into control, BPA-treated, BPA + PCA50, BPA + PCA100, and PCA100 groups. BPA exposure for 14 days induced oxidative stress, evidenced by elevated malondialdehyde levels and decreased activities of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase). Higher doses of PCA effectively mitigated these effects by restoring redox balance and enhancing antioxidant enzyme activities. Additionally, BPA disrupted inflammation and apoptosis pathways, inhibiting anti-inflammatory markers and interfering with the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2/heme oxygenase-1 (Nrf2/HO-1) pathway. PCA exhibited dose-dependent protection against these disruptions. Computational analyses revealed that BPA inhibits cyclooxygenase-1 through stable hydrogen bonding with threonine at position 322. PCA’s dual protective effect was confirmed by attenuating inflammatory pathways, including TNF-α inhibition and suppression of the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1) and Nrf2 signaling pathway. Histopathological assessments confirmed that PCA alleviated significant hepatic damage induced by BPA. Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence analyses further supported PCA’s protective role against BPA-induced apoptosis and cellular hepatotoxicity.

         "Introduction, Recent artificial intelligence (AI) advances can generate human-like responses to a wide range of queries, making them a useful tool for healthcare applications. Therefore, the potential use of large language models (LLMs) in controlled environments regarding efficacy, reproducibility, and operability will be of paramount interest., Objective, We investigated if and how GPT 3.5 and GPT 4 models can be directly used as a part of a GxP validated system and compared the performance of externally hosted GPT 3.5 and GPT 4 against LLMs, which can be hosted internally. We explored zero-shot LLM performance for named entity recognition (NER) and relation extraction tasks, investigated which LLM has the best zero-shot performance to be used potentially for generating training data proposals, evaluated the LLM performance of seven entities for medical NER in zero-shot experiments, selected one model for further performance improvement (few-shot and fine-tuning: Zephyr-7b-beta), and investigated how smaller open-source LLMs perform in contrast to GPT models and to a small fine-tuned T5 Base., Methods, We performed reproducibility experiments to evaluate if LLMs can be used in controlled environments and utilized guided generation to use the same prompt across multiple models. Few-shot learning and quantized low rank adapter (QLoRA) fine-tuning were applied to further improve LLM performance., Results and Conclusion, We demonstrated that zero-shot GPT 4 performance is comparable with a fine-tuned T5, and Zephyr performed better than zero-shot GPT 3.5, but the recognition of product combinations such as product event combination was significantly better by using a fine-tuned T5. Although Open AI launched recently GPT versions to improve the generation of consistent output, both GPT variants failed to demonstrate reproducible results. The lack of reproducibility together with limitations of external hosted systems to keep validated systems in a state of control may affect the use of closed and proprietary models in regulated environments.

         "In the field of treatment and prevention of immune-related bone diseases, significant challenges persist, necessitating the urgent exploration of new and effective treatment methods. However, most existing Mendelian randomization (MR) studies are confined to a single analytical approach, which limits the comprehensive understanding of the pathogenesis and potential therapeutic targets of these diseases. In light of this, we propose the hypothesis that genetic variations in specific plasma proteins have a causal relationship with immune-related bone diseases through the MR mechanism, and that key therapeutic targets can be accurately identified using an integrated multi-omic analysis approach. This study comprehensively applied a variety of analytical methods. Firstly, the protein quantitative trait locus (pQTLs) data from two large plasma protein databases and the Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) data of nine immune-related bone diseases were used for Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. At the same time, we employed the Summary-based Mendelian Randomization (SMR) method, combined with the Bayesian colocalization analysis method of coding genes, as well as the Linkage Disequilibrium Score Regression (LDSC) analysis method based on genetic correlation analysis, as methods to verify the genetic association between genes and complex diseases, thus comprehensively obtaining positive results. In addition, a Phenome-wide Association Study (PheWAS) was conducted on significantly positive genes, and their expression patterns in different tissues were also explored. Subsequently, we integrated Protein–Protein Interaction (PPI) network analysis, Gene Ontology (GO) analysis. Finally, based on the above analytical methods, drug prediction and molecular docking studies were carried out with the aim of accurately identifying key therapeutic targets. Through a comprehensive analysis using four methods, namely the Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis study, Summary-based Mendelian Randomization (SMR) analysis study, Bayesian colocalization analysis study, and Linkage Disequilibrium Score Regression (LDSC) analysis study. We found that through MR, SMR, and combined with Bayesian colocalization analysis, an association was found between rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and HDGF. Using the combination of MR and Bayesian colocalization analysis, as well as LDSC analysis, it was concluded that RA was related to CCL19 and TNFRSF14. Based on the methods of MR and Bayesian colocalization, an association was found between GPT and Crohn’s disease-related arthritis, and associations were found between BTN1A1, EVI5, OGA, TNFRSF14 and multiple sclerosis (MS), and associations were found between ICAM5, CCDC50, IL17RD, UBLCP1 and psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Specifically, in the MR analysis of RA, HDGF (P_ivw = 0.0338, OR = 1.0373, 95%CI = 1.0028—1.0730), CCL19 (P_ivw = 0.0004, OR = 0.3885, 95%CI = 0.2299—0.6566), TNFRSF14 (P_ivw = 0.0007, OR = 0.6947, 95%CI = 0.5634—0.8566); in the MR analysis of MS, BTN1A1 (P_ivw = 0.0000, OR = 0.6101, 95%CI = 0.4813—0.7733), EVI5 (P_ivw = 0.0000, OR = 0.3032, 95%CI = 0.1981—0.4642), OGA (P_ivw = 0.0005, OR = 0.4599, 95%CI = 0.2966—0.7131), TNFRSF14 (P_ivw = 0.0002, OR = 0.4026, 95%CI = 0.2505—0.6471); in the MR analysis of PsA, ICAM5 (P_ivw = 0.0281, OR = 1.1742, 95%CI = 1.0174—1.3552), CCDC50 (P_ivw = 0.0092, OR = 0.7359, 95%CI = 0.5843—0.9269), IL17RD (P_ivw = 0.0006, OR = 0.7887, 95%CI = 0.6886—0.9034), UBLCP1 (P_ivw = 0.0021, OR = 0.6901, 95%CI = 0.5448—0.8741); in the MR analysis of Crohn’s disease-related arthritis, GPT (P_ivw = 0.0006, OR = 0.0057, 95%CI = 0.0003—0.1111). In the Bayesian colocalization analysis of RA, HDGF (H4 = 0.8426), CCL19 (H4 = 0.9762), TNFRSF14 (H4 = 0.8016); in the Bayesian colocalization analysis of MS, BTN1A1 (H4 = 0.7660), EVI5 (H4 = 0.9800), OGA (H4 = 0.8569), TNFRSF14 (H4 = 0.8904); in the Bayesian colocalization analysis of PsA, ICAM5 (H4 = 0.9476), CCDC50 (H4 = 0.9091), IL17RD (H4 = 0.9301), UBLCP1 (H4 = 0.8862); in the Bayesian colocalization analysis of Crohn’s disease-related arthritis, GPT (H4 = 0.8126). In the SMR analysis of RA, HDGF (p_SMR = 0.0338, p_HEIDI = 0.0628). In the LDSC analysis of RA, CCL19 (P = 0.0000), TNFRSF14 (P = 0.0258). By comprehensively analyzing plasma proteomic and transcriptomic data, we successfully identified key therapeutic targets for various clinical subtypes of immune-associated bone diseases. Our findings indicate that the significant positive genes associated with RA include HDGF, CCL19, and TNFRSF14; the positive gene linked to Crohn-related arthropathy is GPT; for MS, the positive genes are BTN1A1, EVI5, OGA, and TNFRSF14; and for PsA, the positive genes are ICAM5, CCDC50, IL17RD, and UBLCP1. Through this comprehensive analytical approach, we have screened potential therapeutic targets for different clinical subtypes of immune-related bone diseases. This research not only enhances our understanding of the pathogenesis of these conditions but also provides a solid theoretical foundation for subsequent drug development and clinical treatment, with the potential to yield significant advancements in the management of patients with immune-related bone diseases.",

         "exploring new drug treatment targets for immune related bone diseases using a multi omics joint analysis strategy. in the field of treatment and prevention of immune-related bone diseases, significant challenges persist, necessitating the urgent exploration of new and effective treatment methods. however, most existing mendelian randomization (mr) studies are confined to a single analytical approach, which limits the comprehensive understanding of the pathogenesis and potential therapeutic targets of these diseases. in light of this, we propose the hypothesis that genetic variations in specific plasma proteins have a causal relationship with immune-related bone diseases through the mr mechanism, and that key therapeutic targets can be accurately identified using an integrated multi-omic analysis approach. this study comprehensively applied a variety of analytical methods. firstly, the protein quantitative trait locus (pqtls) data from two large plasma protein databases and the genome-wide association study (gwas) data of nine immune-related bone diseases were used for mendelian randomization (mr) analysis. at the same time, we employed the summary-based mendelian randomization (smr) method, combined with the bayesian colocalization analysis method of coding genes, as well as the linkage disequilibrium score regression (ldsc) analysis method based on genetic correlation analysis, as methods to verify the genetic association between genes and complex diseases, thus comprehensively obtaining positive results. in addition, a phenome-wide association study (phewas) was conducted on significantly positive genes, and their expression patterns in different tissues were also explored. subsequently, we integrated protein–protein interaction (ppi) network analysis, gene ontology (go) analysis. finally, based on the above analytical methods, drug prediction and molecular docking studies were carried out with the aim of accurately identifying key therapeutic targets. through a comprehensive analysis using four methods, namely the mendelian randomization (mr) analysis study, summary-based mendelian randomization (smr) analysis study, bayesian colocalization analysis study, and linkage disequilibrium score regression (ldsc) analysis study. we found that through mr, smr, and combined with bayesian colocalization analysis, an association was found between rheumatoid arthritis (ra) and hdgf. using the combination of mr and bayesian colocalization analysis, as well as ldsc analysis, it was concluded that ra was related to ccl19 and tnfrsf14. based on the methods of mr and bayesian colocalization, an association was found between gpt and crohn’s disease-related arthritis, and associations were found between btn1a1, evi5, oga, tnfrsf14 and multiple sclerosis (ms), and associations were found between icam5, ccdc50, il17rd, ublcp1 and psoriatic arthritis (psa). specifically, in the mr analysis of ra, hdgf (p_ivw = 0.0338, or = 1.0373, 95%ci = 1.0028—1.0730), ccl19 (p_ivw = 0.0004, or = 0.3885, 95%ci = 0.2299—0.6566), tnfrsf14 (p_ivw = 0.0007, or = 0.6947, 95%ci = 0.5634—0.8566);

in the mr analysis of crohn’s disease-related arthritis, gpt (p_ivw = 0.0006, or = 0.0057, 95%ci = 0.0003—0.1111). in the bayesian colocalization analysis of ra, hdgf (h4 = 0.8426), ccl19 (h4 = 0.9762), tnfrsf14 (h4 = 0.8016); in the bayesian colocalization analysis of ms, btn1a1 (h4 = 0.7660), evi5 (h4 = 0.9800), oga (h4 = 0.8569), tnfrsf14 (h4 = 0.8904); in the bayesian colocalization analysis of psa, icam5 (h4 = 0.9476), ccdc50 (h4 = 0.9091), il17rd (h4 = 0.9301), ublcp1 (h4 = 0.8862);

the positive gene linked to crohn-related arthropathy is gpt; for ms, the positive genes are btn1a1, evi5, oga, and tnfrsf14; and for psa, the positive genes are icam5, ccdc50, il17rd, and ublcp1. through this comprehensive analytical approach, we have screened potential therapeutic targets for different clinical subtypes of immune-related bone diseases. this research not only enhances our understanding of the pathogenesis of these conditions but also provides a solid theoretical foundation for subsequent drug development and clinical treatment, with the potential to yield significant advancements in the management of patients with immune-related bone diseases.",

         "Background, Drug-target binding affinity (DTA) prediction is vital in drug discovery and repositioning, more and more researchers are beginning to focus on this. Many effective methods have been proposed. However, some current methods have certain shortcomings in focusing on important nodes in drug molecular graphs and dealing with complex structural molecules. In particular, when considering important nodes and complex substructures in molecules, they may not be able to fully explore the potential relationships between different parts. In addition, when dealing with protein structures, some methods ignore the connections between amino acid fragments that are far apart in sequence but may work synergistically in function., Results, In this paper, we propose a new method, called GS-DTA, for predicting DTA based on graph and sequence models. GS-DTA takes simplified molecular input line input system (SMILES) of the drug and the protein amino acid sequence as input. First, each drug is modeled as a graph, in which a vertex is an atom and an edge represents interaction between atoms. Then GATv2-GCN and the three-layer GCN networks are used to extract the features of the drug. GATv2-GCN enhances the model’s ability to focus on important nodes by assigning dynamic attention scores, which improves the learning of the graph structure’s intricate patterns. Besides, The three-layer GCN can captures hierarchical features of the drug through deeper propagation and feature transformation. Meanwhile, for each protein, a framework combining CNN, Bi-LSTM, and Transformer is used to extract the contextual and structural information of the protein amino acid sequences, and this combination can help to understand a comprehensive and detailed features of the protein. Finally, the obtained drug and protein feature vectors are combined to predict DTA through the fully connected layer. The source code can be downloaded from https://github.com/zhuziguang/GS-DTA ., Conclusions, The results show that GS-DTA achieves good performance in terms of MSE, CI, and r^2_m on the Davis and KIBA datasets, improving the accuracy of DTA prediction.",

         "gs-dta: integrating graph and sequence models for predicting drug-target binding affinity. background, drug-target binding affinity (dta) prediction is vital in drug discovery and repositioning, more and more researchers are beginning to focus on this. many effective methods have been proposed. however, some current methods have certain shortcomings in focusing on important nodes in drug molecular graphs and dealing with complex structural molecules. in particular, when considering important nodes and complex substructures in molecules, they may not be able to fully explore the potential relationships between different parts. in addition, when dealing with protein structures, some methods ignore the connections between amino acid fragments that are far apart in sequence but may work synergistically in function., results, in this paper, we propose a new method, called gs-dta, for predicting dta based on graph and sequence models. gs-dta takes simplified molecular input line input system (smiles) of the drug and the protein amino acid sequence as input. first, each drug is modeled as a graph, in which a vertex is an atom and an edge represents interaction between atoms. then gatv2-gcn and the three-layer gcn networks are used to extract the features of the drug. gatv2-gcn enhances the model’s ability to focus on important nodes by assigning dynamic attention scores, which improves the learning of the graph structure’s intricate patterns. besides, the three-layer gcn can captures hierarchical features of the drug through deeper propagation and feature transformation. meanwhile, for each protein, a framework combining cnn, bi-lstm, and transformer is used to extract the contextual and structural information of the protein amino acid sequences, and this combination can help to understand a comprehensive and detailed features of the protein. finally, the obtained drug and protein feature vectors are combined to predict dta through the fully connected layer. the source code can be downloaded from https://github.com/zhuziguang/gs-dta ., conclusions, the results show that gs-dta achieves good performance in terms of mse, ci, and r^2_m on the davis and kiba datasets, improving the accuracy of dta prediction.",

This study explores the potential of compounds from Echinacea angustifolia ( E. angustifolia ) to inhibit the activity of ZIKV’s RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP), a key enzyme in the viral replication process and an ideal candidate for antiviral therapy. Utilizing computational techniques, we conducted a thorough virtual examination using the MTi-OpenScreen tool to identify potential RDRP inhibitors among E. angustifolia compounds.

This investigation highlighted four naturally occurring compounds, viz., Echinacoside, Rutin, Echinacin, and Cynaroside, demonstrating a notable affinity for binding to the allosteric site of ZIKV RDRP. These compounds showed strong hydrogen bond formation with crucial residues of the RDRP and presented favorable binding free energies.

         "Background, Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) induces cellular senescence and tumor stasis, thus serving as the standard treatment for prostate cancer (PCa). However, continuous suppression of canonical androgen receptor signaling actually leads to the switch from androgen-responsive growth to androgen-independent growth, contributing to “escape” from this ADT-induced senescence (AIS) and, subsequently, the development of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Unfortunately, the mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains elusive., Results, In this study, we demonstrated that androgen receptor splicing variant 7 (ARv7), a dominant factor mediating abnormal AR signaling and ADT resistance, is closely associated with outgrowth from AIS of PCa cells. Mechanistically, ARv7 binds to the promoter of SKP2 , activating its transcription, and then promotes the proteasomal degradation of the cell cycle regulator p27 and G1/S transition. In addition, we applied bioinformatic and in vitro analyses to show that SKP2 expression level is dramatically inhibited upon ADT, but its reactivation is one key step during the establishment of CRPC. Finally, we also demonstrated that SKP2 inhibitor treatment can significantly inhibit the growth of androgen-independent cell lines and enhance the efficacy of ADT., Conclusions, Our work reveals a novel role of ARv7 in regulating AIS and suggests that targeting the ARv7/SKP2/p27 axis could be a potential strategy to delay disease progression to the CRPC state during prolonged ADT.",

         "Pharmacological suppression of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transaminase (GABA-T), the sole GABA-degrading enzyme and a potential therapeutic target for treating brain disorders such as epilepsy, increases not only phasic inhibition but also tonic inhibition. However, the specific cellular source, neuromodulatory effects and potential therapeutic benefits of this enhanced tonic inhibition remain unexplored due to the lack of cell-type-specific gene manipulation studies. Here we report that the increase in tonic GABA currents observed after GABA-T suppression is predominantly due to increased tonic GABA release from astrocytes rather than action-potential-dependent synaptic GABA spillover. General GABA-T knockdown (KD) by a short hairpin RNA considerably increased tonic GABA currents in dentate granule cells, thereby enhancing tonic inhibition. An astrocyte-specific rescue of GABA-T following general GABA-T KD normalized the elevated tonic GABA currents to near control levels. Tetrodotoxin-insensitive tonic GABA currents were significantly increased after general GABA-T KD, whereas tetrodotoxin-sensitive tonic GABA currents showed no significant increase, suggesting that this enhanced tonic inhibition is primarily action-potential independent. General GABA-T KD reduced the spike probability of granule cells and impaired dorsal hippocampus-dependent spatial memory, which were fully reversed by astrocyte-specific GABA-T rescue. These findings suggest that suppressing astrocytic GABA-T may be sufficient to influence the excitatory/inhibitory balance in the brain and associated behaviors. Our study implies that the therapeutic benefits of pharmacological GABA-T suppression may be largely attributed to the modulation of astrocytic GABA-T and its impact on tonic GABA release from astrocytes. Here, we report distinct effects of GABA-T suppression depending on cell type; suppressing GABA-T in astrocytes enhances tonic inhibition, while its suppression in GABAergic neurons augments phasic inhibition. Our findings demonstrate that targeted suppression of astrocytic GABA-T not only enhances tonic GABA release from astrocytes but also significantly influences the excitation/inhibition balance in the brain, with consequential effects on behavior. This suggests that astrocytic GABA-T modulation holds promising potential for developing novel therapeutic strategies aimed at treating cognitive and neurological disorders through the regulation of astrocytic GABA metabolism.

Aside from clinical methods, artificial intelligence (AI)-based solutions such as machine learning (ML) models have been employed in treating COVID-19 cases. However, limited application of AI for COVID-19 in Africa has been reported in the literature. This study aimed to investigate the performance and interpretability of several ML algorithms, including deep multilayer perceptron (Deep MLP), support vector machine (SVM) and Extreme gradient boosting trees (XGBoost) for predicting COVID-19 mortality risk with an emphasis on the effect of cross-validation (CV) and principal component analysis (PCA) on the results. For this purpose, a dataset with 154 features from 490 COVID-19 patients admitted into the intensive care unit (ICU) of Tygerberg Hospital in Cape Town, South Africa, during the first wave of COVID-19 in 2020 was retrospectively analysed. Our results show that Deep MLP had the best overall performance (F1 = 0.92; area under the curve (AUC) = 0.94) when CV and the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) were applied without PCA. By using the Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) model to interpret the mortality risk predictions, we identified the Length of stay (LOS) in the hospital, LOS in the ICU, Time to ICU from admission, days discharged alive or death, D-dimer (blood clotting factor), and blood pH as the six most critical variables for mortality risk prediction. Also, Age at admission, Pf ratio (PaO2/FiO2 ratio), troponin T (TropT), ferritin, ventilation, C-reactive protein (CRP), and symptoms of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) were associated with the severity and fatality of COVID-19 cases. The study reveals how ML could assist medical practitioners in making informed decisions on handling critically ill COVID-19 patients with comorbidities. It also offers insight into the combined effect of CV, PCA, and SMOTE on the performance of ML models for COVID-19 mortality risk prediction, which has been little explored.",

         "Autoimmune encephalitis (AE) is an immune-mediated non-infectious disease, and novel and robust biomarkers are needed to improve the diagnosis and prognostic outcomes of AE. Oxidative stress is a ubiquitous cellular process causing damage to various biological molecules. The aim of our study was to understand the clinical implication and mechanism underlying oxidative stress in AE. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis was conducted on the serum of eight patients with AE and seven healthy controls, and oxidative stress was characterized. Experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) models were established in C57BL/6 and SJL mice for investigation of the therapeutic effect and mechanism of anti-oxidative stress N -acetylcysteine (NAC). We provided proteomic landscape in the serum of AE and identified antioxidant ALB, APOE, GPX3, and SOD3 as serum diagnostic markers of AE. The antioxidant markers were lowly expressed both in the serum of AE patients and central nervous system (CNS) of EAE mice. NAC administration improved clinical signs and motor function and alleviated nerve injury of EAE mice as well as lowered oxidative stress (decreased MDA content and ROS accumulation and elevated SOD activity and GSH content). ALB, APOE, GPX3, and SOD3 expressions were elevated by NAC in the CNS of EAE mice. Moreover, NAC reduced tissue-resident CD4^+ and CD8^+ T cells and GFAP-marked astrocytes and Iba-1-marked microglia in EAE mice, thus alleviating autoimmunity-mediated damage and neuroinflammation. Our findings facilitate the discovery of novel oxidative stress-related biomarkers for AE and reveal the promise of anti-oxidative stress for AE management.",

This study seeks to predict patterns of substance use, aiming to identify the driving factors behind these trends using artificial intelligence techniques. This research utilizes data from the 2022 Finnish National Drug Survey, comprising 3,857 participants, to develop predictive models targeting the use of cannabis, ecstasy, amphetamine, cocaine, and non-prescribed medications. Analysis of 23 questionnaire items yielded 76 features across four substance use dimensions: demographic attributes, experience and preferences of drug use, health-related aspects of drug use, and social attributes of drug use. In addition to traditional machine learning (ML) approaches previously applied in this field, three sophisticated deep learning models—standard LSTM, BiLSTM, and Recursive LSTM—were employed to evaluate their predictive performance. These LSTM models were further augmented with SHAP analysis to identify the primary influences on substance use patterns. While all these artificial intelligence models demonstrated superior predictive performance, our focus was specifically on the outcomes of the LSTM models due to their novel application in this field. The results underscore the exceptional performance of both LSTM and ML models in unraveling complex substance use behaviors, underlining their applicability in diverse public health contexts. This study not only sheds light on the predictors of substance uses but also furthers methodological innovation in drug research, charting new directions for crafting targeted intervention strategies and policies. The observed variability in predictor significance across different substances indicates the necessity for tailored prevention programs catering to particular user groups.

We studied individuals with histopathologically proven adenocarcinoma or SCC type NSCLC tumours, detected as lung nodules on Chest CT. The workflow comprised manual nodule segmentation, regions of interest creation, preprocessing data, feature extraction, and nodule classification using machine learning algorithms. The dataset comprised 46 adenocarcinoma and 28 SCC cases. For feature extraction, 101 radiomic features were extracted from the tumour regions using the ‘pyradiomics’ module in Python. After extensive experimentation with various feature importance techniques, the top 10 most significant radiomic features for differentiating between adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) were identified. The Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique was used to achieve a balanced distribution. Lung nodules were classified using 13 machine-learning algorithms, including Linear Discriminant Analysis, Random Forest, AdaBoost, and eXtreme Gradient Boosting. The Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Classifier with Rectified Linear Unit (ReLu) activation was the most accurate (83% accuracy) with 83% precision and 86% sensitivity in distinguishing SCC from adenocarcinoma. It achieved a balanced F1 score of 83%, indicating well-rounded performance in both precision and sensitivity. The average Area Under the Curve score was 88%, representing good discrimination between the two classes of lung nodules.

Techniques such as 10-fold cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning were implemented to prevent overfitting. The study also focused on interpretability through Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP). The evaluation of model’s performance was based on accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, F1-score, and ROC curve metrics. Among DL models, LSTM showed superior sensitivity at 96.15%, while FNN exhibited better specificity (96.0%), accuracy (96.0%), F1-score (95.0%), and ROC (98.0%) among DL models. For ML models, RF displayed higher sensitivity (99.9%), accuracy (99.0%), specificity (100%), F1-score (99.0%), and ROC (99.9%).

         "Hyperparameter optimization is very frequently employed in machine learning. However, an optimization of a large space of parameters could result in overfitting of models. In recent studies on solubility prediction the authors collected seven thermodynamic and kinetic solubility datasets from different data sources. They used state-of-the-art graph-based methods and compared models developed for each dataset using different data cleaning protocols and hyperparameter optimization. In our study we showed that hyperparameter optimization did not always result in better models, possibly due to overfitting when using the same statistical measures.

It is becoming a leading cause of end-stage liver diseases such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Despite its increasing prevalence, effective pharmacotherapies for MASH remain limited, underscoring the urgent need for novel interventions. Amlexanox, an inhibitor of noncanonical IκB kinases, has demonstrated potential in restoring insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis in obese mice and human patients, as shown in our earlier studies. Here, we aimed to assess the therapeutic potential of amlexanox in dyslipidemia-associated diseases, particularly MASH and HCC, and to elucidate the underlying mechanism. We employed GAN diet-fed Ldlr ^ −/− mice, which simultaneously develop obesity, MASH, and atherosclerosis, to recapitulate human metabolic syndrome and associated complications. Amlexanox was administrated orally to these mice after disease onset to examine its therapeutic efficacy. Our study demonstrates that even a low dose of amlexanox significantly reversed MASH and nearly completely prevented the progression from MASH to HCC. Both phenotypic and transcriptomic studies revealed that amlexanox markedly improved MASH-related dyslipidemia, hepatic steatosis, inflammation, liver injury, and hepatic fibrosis. Furthermore, multi-omics analysis revealed that amlexanox enhances hepatic bile acid synthesis and promotes fecal bile acid excretion. Notably, amlexanox reprogrammed gut microbiota, robustly increasing the abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila , a probiotic known to improve metabolic dysfunction. These findings uncover the multifaceted therapeutic potential of amlexanox in treating MASH and atherosclerosis by targeting bile acid metabolism, gut microbiota, hepatic inflammation, and fibrosis.

A two-step virtual screening was performed, identifying 76 ligands binding to the active site, while 10 showed binding energies below -7 kcal/mol. Ligands 1–3 exhibited better binding affinities than the Ribavirin. Lig-3 demonstrated the most intense interaction. These interacted through hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions with the key catalytic motifs that may disrupt viral replication by inhibiting polymerase activities. Next, the effects of these ligands induced in polymerase structure and dynamics were analyzed by 300 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, showing that ligand binding altered structural dynamics in critical motifs responsible for NTP and RNA template binding. RMSF and PCA analyses revealed reduced protein mobility and significant structural destabilization, particularly for Lig-1 and Lig-3 in SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and Lig-2 and Lig-3 in HCV NS5B. Additionally, Rg and SASA analyses indicated structural compression in ligand-bound complexes, corroborating the hypothesis of enzymatic inhibition.

First, by layering geometric self-attention units on top of residue-level 3D CNN outputs, our model overcomes the problems of CNN-only architectures. Second, by configuring the fundamental units of computation as residues and pockets instead of voxels, our method reduced the information loss from post-processing. Lastly, by employing inter-resolution transfer learning and homology-based augmentation, our method maximizes the utilization of available data sources to a significant extent., Results, The proposed method significantly outperformed all state-of-the-art baselines regarding both resolutions—pocket and residue.

Furthermore, dengue and chikungunya viruses were not detected from the Ae. aegypti examined., Conclusion, The majority of Ae. aegypti collections were made during the wet season from outdoor resting sites, particularly from tyres. Thus, outdoor targeted management of Ae. aegypti is recommended as a strategy particularly tyre removal during the wet season, to reduce resting and proliferation of Ae. aegypti and hence prevent the risks of Aedes- borne disease transmission.",

         "Background, Prostate cancer (PCa) is a highly prevalent malignancy among men, with significant regional variations in incidence and poor survival rates in advanced stages. Ribosome biogenesis (RB) is pivotal for cancer cell proliferation, yet the specific role of the ribosomal biogenesis factor (RBIS) gene in PCa remains underexplored. This study aims to elucidate the biological and clinical relevance of RBIS in PCa progression., Methods, We analyzed RNA-sequencing data from the TCGA database and three GEO datasets to compare RBIS expression in normal versus tumor tissues. The relationship between RBIS expression and clinicopathological features, including tumor stage, Gleason score, and progression-free survival (PFS), was assessed. Co-expression and functional enrichment analyses identified key biological processes involving RBIS, while genetic alterations, immune infiltration, and drug sensitivity were also evaluated., Results, RBIS expression was significantly higher in PCa tissues and correlated with advanced tumor stage, higher Gleason scores, and poorer PFS. Multivariate analysis confirmed RBIS as an independent prognostic marker. Functional analysis implicated RBIS in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. Moreover, RBIS expression was associated with immune cell infiltration and drug sensitivity, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target., Conclusion, RBIS represents a promising biomarker for PCa diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy. Further research is required to validate these findings and advance RBIS's clinical application, offering novel insights into PCa management.",

         "While in theory antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) deliver high-dose chemotherapy directly to target cells, numerous side effects are observed in clinical practice. We sought to determine the effect of linker design (cleavable versus non-cleavable), drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR), and free payload concentration on systemic toxicity. Two systematic reviews were performed via PubMed search of clinical trials published between January 1998—July 2022. Eligible studies: (1) clinical trial for cancer therapy in adults, (2) ≥ 1 study arm included a single-agent ADC, (3) ADC used was commercially available/FDA-approved. Data was extracted and pooled using generalized linear mixed effects logistic models. 40 clinical trials involving 7,879 patients from 11 ADCs, including 9 ADCs with cleavable linkers ( N  = 2,985) and 2 with non-cleavable linkers ( N  = 4,894), were included. Significantly more composite adverse events (AEs) ≥ grade 3 occurred in patients in the cleavable linkers arm (47%) compared with the non-cleavable arm (34%). When adjusted for DAR, for grade ≥ 3 toxicities, non-cleavable linkers remained independently associated with lower toxicity for any AE ( p  = 0.002). Higher DAR was significantly associated with higher probability of grade ≥ 3 toxicity for any AE. There was also a significant interaction between cleavability status and DAR for any AE ( p  = 0.002). Finally, higher measured systemic free payload concentrations were significantly associated with higher DARs ( p  = 0.043). Our results support the hypothesis that ADCs with cleavable linkers result in premature payload release, leading to increased systemic free payload concentrations and associated toxicities. This may help to inform future ADC design and rational clinical application.",

Our previous study provided a new insight of cholesterol metabolism in the systematic management of PCa. However, the comprehensive role of cholesterol metabolism in PCa remains unclear., Methods, Using the cholesterol metabolism related genes (CMRGs) downloaded from the MSigDB database, and gene expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), we constructed a cholesterol risk index by the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) model, and correlated the risk index with prognosis, tumor mutation burden (TMB), tumor microenvironment (TME) infiltration and response to chemotherapy and immunotherapy. RT-qPCR, western blot, immunohistochemistry, cell proliferation assays by CCK-8 and EdU assays, and cell apoptosis assays by flow cytometry analysis were also performed., Results, We found PCa was tightly correlated with the cholesterol metabolism pathways. The cholesterol risk index was an excellent and independent predictor of prognosis for PCa. A nomogram involving the risk index and other clinical factors (age, T stage) was established to explore the clinical value of risk index. We found high-risk index group was associated with worse prognosis, higher TMB, lower infiltration level of CD8^+ T cells and a worse response to chemotherapy and immunotherapy. RT-qPCR, western blot and immunohistochemical staining validated the expression level of important CMRGs in PCa. In vitro experiments revealed downregulation of cholesterol metabolism could inhibit the proliferation of PCa cells and promoted their apoptosis., Conclusions, We demonstrated the comprehensive role of cholesterol metabolism in PCa. Using the risk index, we could predict the prognosis, TME infiltration and response to chemotherapy/immunotherapy of PCa. Better understanding and evaluating the cholesterol metabolism could aid in precision medicine and promoting prognosis of PCa.",

Current trajectory prediction models often struggle in noisy scenarios due to their lack of robustness. This study introduces the Noise-Robust Autoregressive Transformer, a novel model that enhances prediction reliability by integrating noise-regularized embeddings within a multi-head attention equipped with hybrid positional encoding. This model effectively captures essential temporal-spatial relationships and manages positional information more precisely across varied trajectories. Moreover, we formulate the robust trajectory prediction problem as an autoregressive approach that models the encoding of historical data and the decoding of future positions as a sequence-to-sequence learning problem. Our approach effectively captures positional encodings for the complex spatial-temporal variations in aircraft trajectory prediction, improving long-term prediction accuracy while achieving real-time responsiveness. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate our improvement over existing aircraft trajectory prediction methods.",

         "Background, Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) remain the leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally. Traditional risk models, primarily based on established risk factors, often lack the precision needed to accurately predict new-onset major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). This study aimed to improve prediction and risk stratification by integrating traditional risk factors with biochemical and metabolomic biomarkers., Methods, We analyzed data from 229,352 participants in the UK Biobank (median age 58.0 years; 45.4% male) who were free of baseline MACE. Biomarker selection was conducted using area under the curve (AUC), minimal joint mutual information maximization (JMIM), and correlation analyses, while Cox proportional hazards models were employed to evaluate the predictive performance of combined traditional risk factors and biomarkers. Optimal binary thresholds were determined utilizing CatBoost and SHAP, leading to the calculation of a Biomarker Risk Score (BRS) for each participant. Multivariable Cox models were conducted to assess the associations of each concerned biomarker and BRS with new-onset endpoints., Results, The combination of PANEL + All Biochemistry + Cor0.95 of Nonov Met predictors demonstrated significantly improved discriminative performance compared to traditional models, such as Age + Sex and ASCVD, across all endpoints. Although the prediction for hemorrhagic stroke was suboptimal (C-index = 0.699), C-index values for other outcomes surpassed 0.75, with the highest value (0.822) recorded for CVD-related mortality. Key predictors of new-onset MACE included cystatin C, HbA1c, GlycA, and GGT, while IGF-1 and DHA exhibited potential protective effects. The BRS stratified individuals into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups, with the strongest effect observed for CVD death, where the high-risk group had a relative risk of 2.76 (95% CI 2.48–3.07) compared to the low-risk group., Conclusion, Integrating traditional risk factors and biomarkers improves prediction and risk stratification of new-onset MACE. The BRS shows promise as a tool for identifying high-risk individuals, with the potential to support personalized CVD prevention and management strategies., Graphical abstract, ",

         "improved prediction and risk stratification of major adverse cardiovascular events using an explainable machine learning approach combining plasma biomarkers and traditional risk factors. background, cardiovascular diseases (cvd) remain the leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally. traditional risk models, primarily based on established risk factors, often lack the precision needed to accurately predict new-onset major adverse cardiovascular events (mace). this study aimed to improve prediction and risk stratification by integrating traditional risk factors with biochemical and metabolomic biomarkers., methods, we analyzed data from 229,352 participants in the uk biobank (median age 58.0 years; 45.4% male) who were free of baseline mace. biomarker selection was conducted using area under the curve (auc), minimal joint mutual information maximization (jmim), and correlation analyses, while cox proportional hazards models were employed to evaluate the predictive performance of combined traditional risk factors and biomarkers. optimal binary thresholds were determined utilizing catboost and shap, leading to the calculation of a biomarker risk score (brs) for each participant. multivariable cox models were conducted to assess the associations of each concerned biomarker and brs with new-onset endpoints., results, the combination of panel + all biochemistry + cor0.95 of nonov met predictors demonstrated significantly improved discriminative performance compared to traditional models, such as age + sex and ascvd, across all endpoints. although the prediction for hemorrhagic stroke was suboptimal (c-index = 0.699), c-index values for other outcomes surpassed 0.75, with the highest value (0.822) recorded for cvd-related mortality. key predictors of new-onset mace included cystatin c, hba1c, glyca, and ggt, while igf-1 and dha exhibited potential protective effects. the brs stratified individuals into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups, with the strongest effect observed for cvd death, where the high-risk group had a relative risk of 2.76 (95% ci 2.48–3.07) compared to the low-risk group., conclusion, integrating traditional risk factors and biomarkers improves prediction and risk stratification of new-onset mace. the brs shows promise as a tool for identifying high-risk individuals, with the potential to support personalized cvd prevention and management strategies., graphical abstract, ",

         "With rapid advances of deep neural networks over the past decade, artificial intelligence (AI) systems are now commonplace in many applications in biomedicine. These systems often achieve high predictive accuracy in clinical studies, and increasingly in clinical practice. Yet, despite their commonly high predictive accuracy, the trustworthiness of AI systems needs to be questioned when it comes to decision-making that affects the well-being of patients or the fairness towards patients or other stakeholders affected by AI-based decisions. To address this, the field of explainable artificial intelligence, or XAI for short, has emerged, seeking to provide means by which AI-based decisions can be explained to experts, users, or other stakeholders. While it is commonly claimed that explanations of artificial intelligence (AI) establish the trustworthiness of AI-based decisions, it remains unclear what traits of explanations cause them to foster trustworthiness. Building on historical cases of scientific explanation in medicine, we here propagate our perspective that, in order to foster trustworthiness, explanations in biomedical AI should meet the criteria of being scientific explanations. To further undermine our approach, we discuss its relation to the concepts of causality and randomized intervention. In our perspective, we combine aspects from the three disciplines of biomedicine, machine learning, and philosophy. From this interdisciplinary angle, we shed light on how the explanation and trustworthiness of artificial intelligence relate to the concepts of causality and robustness. To connect our perspective with AI research practice, we review recent cases of AI-based studies in pathology and, finally, provide guidelines on how to connect AI in biomedicine with scientific explanation.",

We employed an extreme gradient boosting (Xgboost) model combined with recursive feature elimination with cross-validation (RFECV) to classify patients and NCs. The study included 54 NCs and 29 patients with dementia. Resting-state EEG was recorded, and Mini-Mental Status Exam (MMSE) and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) assessments were conducted. Significant differences were observed in peak frequency (PF), alpha (A), theta (T), the ratio of alpha to theta (A/T), the ratio of alpha to low-beta (A/BL), and coherence (CH) between patients and NCs. Patients with dementia exhibited decreases in PF, CH_A/T, CH_A/BL, A/T, and A/BL, while an increase in T was noted. The primary finding was that the Xgboost model, a tree ensemble classification, achieved a balanced accuracy of 97.05% with the RFECV-selected feature, which was PF.

The patients’ DTs of the patients were measured by a radiologist using computed tomography (CT) scans from the right and left diaphragm dome level. DT was compared with the progression of respiratory distress and the necessity of intensive care. In statistical analysis, p  < 0.05 was considered significant., Results, Right DT was higher in the group of patients with admission to the ICU ( p  = 0.11). According to multivariate logistic regression analysis, ferritin level (OR = 1; 95% CI = 1–1; p  = 0.014), IL-6 level (OR = 1.004; 95% CI = 1-1.007; p  = 0.045) and higher right DT (OR = 11.015; 95% CI = 3.739–32.447; p  = 0.035) were found to be independent risk factors predicting the ICU admission in COVID-19 patients. There was no significant association with left DT. The predictive value of right DT for ICU requirement in COVID-19 patients was evaluated by ROC analysis. The ROC analysis showed a cut-off value > 1.8, AUC = 0.632, p  = 0.009, 95% Cl (0.558–0.701). In correlation analysis, a positive correlation was found between right DT and ICU admission ( r  = 0.331, p  < 0.001)., Conclusion, Our study is the first to evaluate dome-level DT with CT in elderly patients with COVID-19. In the elderly population, higher right DT levels have been observed to enhance the probability of ICU admission. This may be due to the fact that our sample group consists only of elderly people and the effects of COVID-19. We believe that further validation with more comprehensive studies is needed for DT assessment for clinical treatment decisions, particularly in COVID-19 patients. In addition, we think that the proposal for a standardized measurement site and method for DT measurement will be a guide for future studies., Clinical trial, Not applicable.",

Research findings on sleep abnormalities in individuals with BPD have been inconsistent, with limited evidence linking subjective and objective measures., Methods, We compared 44 women with BPD with 41 healthy controls. We examined differences (using ANCOVAs and ordinal logistic regression) and associations (using correlations) between objective sleep assessment (polysomnography) and subjective measures (Consensus Sleep Diary, Insomnia Severity Index, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index). We explored predictors of insomnia in BPD patients, including BPD severity, symptomatology, comorbid conditions, and medication use, via standard least squares regressions and ANOVAs., Results, A total of 22% of patients with BPD had clinically significant insomnia (cut-off ≥ 15), 85% reported mild (subthreshold) insomnia (cut-off > 10) (Insomnia Severity Index; ISI), and 94% reported sleep quality disturbances (PSQI > 5). Compared with those in HC, PSG results in individuals with BPD revealed a longer duration in bed, longer sleep period, REM latency, wake after sleep onset latency, Stage N1 sleep duration, shorter N2 sleep duration, and, with age, more arousals and awakenings. The correlations between objective and subjective sleep measures were weak in both groups. In patients with BPD, a greater degree of insomnia predicted a reduction in total sleep time and increased awakenings and arousals on PSG. Clinical BPD severity, emotional reactivity and dysregulation, depression symptoms, posttraumatic stress symptoms, alexithymia, and presleep arousal were associated with greater insomnia in BPD patients., Conclusions, Our study confirmed high rates of insomnia and sleep disturbances in individuals with BPD, which contrasted with relatively minor PSG alterations. Clinical BPD severity and symptomatology are associated with sleep abnormalities in individuals with BPD. Insomnia is a neglected yet important characteristic of the BPD phenotype, warranting more attention in future research and clinical guidelines.",

We found 27 lipids associated with SCA in individuals with T2D, including former/current smokers with T2D and those with T2D who do not take lipid-lowering treatment. All lipids associated with SCA except one were annotated exclusively in subjects with T2D, potentially explaining the poorer outcome of atherosclerosis in T2D. Similarly, we found a more disrupted lipid metabolism in former/current smokers with T2D and subjects with T2D who do not take lipid-lowering treatment., Background, Disruption of lipid metabolism contributes to increased cardiovascular risk in diabetes., Methods, We evaluated the associations between serum lipidomic profile and subclinical carotid atherosclerosis (SCA) in type 1 (T1D) and type 2 (T2D) diabetes, and in subjects without diabetes (controls) in a cross-sectional study. All subjects underwent a lipidomic analysis using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography–electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry, carotid ultrasound (mode B) to assess SCA, and clinical assessment. Multiple linear regression models were used to assess the association between features and the presence and burden of SCA in subjects with T1D, T2D, and controls separately. Additionally, multiple linear regression models with interaction terms were employed to determine features significantly associated with SCA within risk groups, including smoking habit, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, antiplatelet use and sex. Depending on the population under study, different confounding factors were considered and adjusted for, including sample origin, sex, age, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, body mass index, waist circumference, glycated haemoglobin, glucose levels, smoking habit, diabetes duration, antiplatelet use, and alanine aminotransferase levels., Results, A total of 513 subjects (151 T1D, 155 T2D, and 207 non-diabetic control) were included, in whom the percentage with SCA was 48.3%, 49.7%, and 46.9%, respectively. A total of 27 unique lipid species were associated with SCA in subjects with T2D, in former/current smokers with T2D, and in individuals with T2D without dyslipidaemia. Phosphatidylcholines and diacylglycerols were the main SCA-associated lipidic classes. Ten different species of phosphatidylcholines were up-regulated, while 4 phosphatidylcholines containing polyunsaturated fatty acids were down-regulated. One diacylglycerol was down-regulated, while the other 3 were positively associated with SCA in individuals with T2D without dyslipidaemia. We discovered several features significantly associated with SCA in individuals with T1D, but only one sterol could be partially annotated., Conclusions, We revealed a significant disruption of lipid metabolism associated with SCA in subjects with T2D, and a larger SCA-associated disruption in former/current smokers with T2D and individuals with T2D who do not undergo lipid-lowering treatment., Graphical abstract, ",

         "lipidomic analysis reveals metabolism alteration associated with subclinical carotid atherosclerosis in type 2 diabetes. atherosclerosis progression is accelerated in individuals with diabetes. however, the underlying mechanisms behind this are not fully understood. through an untargeted lipidomics approach, we investigated lipids associated with subclinical carotid atherosclerosis (sca) in subjects with type 1 diabetes (t1d), type 2 diabetes (t2d) and those without diabetes. we found 27 lipids associated with sca in individuals with t2d, including former/current smokers with t2d and those with t2d who do not take lipid-lowering treatment. all lipids associated with sca except one were annotated exclusively in subjects with t2d, potentially explaining the poorer outcome of atherosclerosis in t2d. similarly, we found a more disrupted lipid metabolism in former/current smokers with t2d and subjects with t2d who do not take lipid-lowering treatment., background, disruption of lipid metabolism contributes to increased cardiovascular risk in diabetes., methods, we evaluated the associations between serum lipidomic profile and subclinical carotid atherosclerosis (sca) in type 1 (t1d) and type 2 (t2d) diabetes, and in subjects without diabetes (controls) in a cross-sectional study. all subjects underwent a lipidomic analysis using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography–electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry, carotid ultrasound (mode b) to assess sca, and clinical assessment. multiple linear regression models were used to assess the association between features and the presence and burden of sca in subjects with t1d, t2d, and controls separately. additionally, multiple linear regression models with interaction terms were employed to determine features significantly associated with sca within risk groups, including smoking habit, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, antiplatelet use and sex. depending on the population under study, different confounding factors were considered and adjusted for, including sample origin, sex, age, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, body mass index, waist circumference, glycated haemoglobin, glucose levels, smoking habit, diabetes duration, antiplatelet use, and alanine aminotransferase levels., results, a total of 513 subjects (151 t1d, 155 t2d, and 207 non-diabetic control) were included, in whom the percentage with sca was 48.3%, 49.7%, and 46.9%, respectively. a total of 27 unique lipid species were associated with sca in subjects with t2d, in former/current smokers with t2d, and in individuals with t2d without dyslipidaemia. phosphatidylcholines and diacylglycerols were the main sca-associated lipidic classes. ten different species of phosphatidylcholines were up-regulated, while 4 phosphatidylcholines containing polyunsaturated fatty acids were down-regulated. one diacylglycerol was down-regulated, while the other 3 were positively associated with sca in individuals with t2d without dyslipidaemia. we discovered several features significantly associated with sca in individuals with t1d, but only one sterol could be partially annotated., conclusions, we revealed a significant disruption of lipid metabolism associated with sca in subjects with t2d, and a larger sca-associated disruption in former/current smokers with t2d and individuals with t2d who do not undergo lipid-lowering treatment., graphical abstract, ",

         "Prenatal brain development is particularly sensitive to chemicals that can disrupt synapse formation and cause neurodevelopmental disorders. In most cases, such chemicals increase cellular oxidative stress. For example, prenatal exposure to the anti-epileptic drug valproic acid (VPA), induces oxidative stress and synaptic alterations, promoting autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in humans and autism-like behaviors in rodents. Using VPA to model chemically induced ASD, we tested whether activation of cellular mechanisms that increase antioxidant gene expression would be sufficient to prevent VPA-induced synaptic alterations. As a master regulator of cellular defense pathways, the transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) promotes expression of detoxification enzymes and antioxidant gene products. To increase NRF2 activity, we used the phytochemical and potent NRF2 activator, sulforaphane (SFN). In our models of human neurodevelopment, SFN activated NRF2, increasing expression of antioxidant genes and preventing oxidative stress. SFN also enhanced expression of genes associated with synapse formation. Consistent with these gene expression profiles, SFN protected developing neural networks from VPA-induced reductions in synapse formation. Furthermore, in mouse cortical neurons, SFN rescued VPA-induced reductions in neural activity. These results demonstrate the ability of SFN to protect developing neural networks during the vulnerable period of synapse formation, while also identifying molecular signatures of SFN-mediated neuroprotection that could be relevant for combatting other environmental toxicants.",

         "Bladder (BL) cancer is the 10th most common cancer worldwide, ranking 9th in males and 13th in females in the United States, respectively. BL cancer is a quick-growing tumor of all cancer forms. Given a malignant tumor’s high malignancy, rapid metastasis prediction and accurate treatment are critical. The most significant drivers of the intricate genesis of cancer are complex genetics, including deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) insertions and deletions, abnormal structure, copy number variations (CNVs), and single nucleotide variations (SNVs). The proposed method enhances the identification of driver genes at the individual patient level by employing attention mechanisms to extract features of both coding and non-coding genes and predict BL cancer based on the personalized driver gene (PDG) detection. The embedded vectors are propagated through the three dense blocks for the binary classification of PDGs. The novel constructure of graph neural network (GNN) with attention mechanism, called Multi Stacked-Layered GAT (MSL-GAT) leverages graph attention mechanisms (GAT) to identify and predict critical driver genes associated with BL cancer progression. In order to pick out and extract essential features from both coding and non-coding genes, including long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), which are known to be crucial to the advancement of BL cancer. The approach analyzes key genetic changes (such as SNVs, CNVs, and structural abnormalities) that lead to tumorigenesis and metastasis by concentrating on personalized driver genes (PDGs). The discovery of genes crucial for the survival and proliferation of cancer cells is made possible by the model’s precise classification of PDGs. MSL-GAT draws attention to certain lncRNAs and other non-coding elements that control carcinogenic pathways by utilizing the attention mechanism. Tumor development, metastasis, and medication resistance are all facilitated by these lncRNAs, which are frequently overexpressed or dysregulated in BL cancer. In order to reduce the survival of cancer cells, the model’s predictions can direct specific treatment approaches, such as RNA interference (RNAi), to mute or suppress the expression of these important genes. MSL-GAT is followed by three dense blocks that spread the embedded vectors to categorize PDGs, making it possible to determine which genes are more likely to cause BL cancer in a certain patient. The model facilitates the identification of new treatment targets by offering a thorough understanding of the molecular landscape of BL cancer through the integration of multi-omics data, encompassing as genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic metadata. We compared the novel approach with classical machine learning methods and other deep learning-based methods on benchmark TCGA-BLCA, and the leave-one-out experimental results showed that MSL-GAT achieved better performance than competitive methods. This approach achieves accuracy with 97.72% and improves specificity and sensitivity. It can potentially aid physicians during early prediction of BL cancer.",

In times of high incidence, a prognostic model based on data efficiently retrieved from one source can enable fast decision support., Methods, A model was developed to identify patients at risk of developing severe COVID-19 within one month based on their age, sex and imaging features extracted from the thoracic computed tomography (CT). The model was trained on publicly available data from the Study of Thoracic CT in COVID-19 (STOIC) challenge and validated on unseen data from the same study and an external, multicentric dataset. The model, trained on data acquired before any variant of concern dominated, was assessed separately on data collected at later stages of the pandemic when the delta and omicron variants were most prevalent., Results, A logistic regression based on handcrafted features was found to perform on par with a direct deep learning approach, and the former was selected for simplicity. Volumetric and intensity-based features of lesions and healthy lung parenchyma proved most predictive, in addition to patient age and sex. The model reached an area under the curve of 0.78 on the challenge test set and 0.74 on the external test set. The performance did not drop for the subset acquired at a later stage of the pandemic., Conclusions, A logistic regression utilizing features from thoracic CT and its metadata can provide rapid decision support by estimating short-term COVID-19 severity. Its stable performance underscores its potential for real-world clinical integration. By enabling rapid risk stratification using readily available imaging data, this approach can support early clinical decision-making, optimize resource allocation, and improve patient management, particularly during surges in COVID-19 cases.

         "Background, Acute mountain sickness (AMS) is a self-limiting illness, involving a complex series of physiological responses to rapid ascent to high altitudes, where the body is exposed to lower oxygen levels (hypoxia) and changes in atmospheric pressure. AMS is the mildest and most common form of altitude sickness; however, without adequate preparation and adherence to ascent guidelines, it can progress to life-threatening conditions., Aims, Due to the multi-factorial predisposition of AMS among individuals, identifying AMS biomarkers before high altitude exposure from multiple dimensions (e.g., clinical, metabolic, and proteomic markers) and integrating them to build an AMS predictive model enables early diagnosis and personalized interventions, which allows targeted allocation of medical resources, such as prophylactic medications (e.g., acetazolamide) and supplemental oxygen, to those who need them most and prevention of unnecessary complications. Consequently, predicting AMS utilizing biomarkers from multidimensional phenotypic data before high-altitude exposure is essential for the paradigm change in high-altitude medical research from currently applied reactive services to the cost-effective predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine (PPPM/3PM) in primary (reversible damage to health and targeted protection against health-to-disease transition) and secondary (personalized protection against disease progression) care., Methods, To this end, this study recruited 83 Han Chinese male volunteers and obtained clinical, proteomic, and metabolomic profiles for analysis before they ascended to high altitudes. The Mann–Whitney U test was used to identify clinical features distinguishing AMS from non-AMS. The proteomic and metabolomic features were concatenated and clustered to find co-expression modules associated with AMS. A machine learning model, Mutual Information-radial kernel-based Support Vector Machine-Recursive Feature Elimination (MI-radialSVM-RFE) was employed for biomarkers selection and AMS prediction. A molecular docking technique was used to select molecular biomarkers that can bind with Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) ingredients., Results, Among 83 participants, 66 were selected for detailed analysis after quality control steps. Six protein-metabolite co-expression modules were identified as significantly associated with AMS. The MI-radialSVM-RFE model selected 12 biomarkers (two clinical features: systolic blood pressure (SBP) and peak expiratory flow (PEF); six proteins: Acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 (ACSL4), immunoglobulin kappa variable 1D-16 (IGKV1D-16), coagulation factor XIII B subunit (F13B), prosaposin (PSAP), poliovirus receptor (PVR), and multimerin-2 (MMRN2); and four metabolites: 2-Methyl-1,3-cyclohexadiene, calcitriol, 4-Acetamido-2-amino-6-nitrotoluene, and 20-Hydroxy-PGE2) for the AMS prediction model. The model exhibited excellent predictive performance in both training ( n  = 66) and validating cohorts ( n  = 24) with AUCs of 0.97 and 0.94, respectively. Additionally, molecular docking analysis suggested PSAP and ACSL4 proteins as potential molecular targets for AMS prevention., Conclusion and expert recommendations, This study advances high-altitude medicine by developing a predictive model for AMS using clinical, proteomic, and metabolomic data. The identified biomarkers linked to energy metabolism, immune response, and vascular regulation offer insights into AMS mechanisms. High-altitude predictive approaches should focus on implementing biomarker-driven risk screening using clinical, proteomic, and metabolomic data to identify high-risk individuals before high-altitude exposure. Preventive measures should prioritize pre-acclimatization protocols, tailored nutritional strategies and interventions guided by biomarker profiles, and lifestyle adjustments, such as maintaining mitochondrial health through proper nutritional strategies.",

         "Major depressive disorder (MDD) presents a substantial health burden with low treatment response rates. Predicting antidepressant efficacy is challenging due to MDD’s complex and varied neuropathology. Identifying biomarkers for antidepressant treatment requires thorough analysis of clinical trial data. Multimodal neuroimaging, combined with advanced data-driven methods, can enhance our understanding of the neurobiological processes influencing treatment outcomes. To address this, we analyzed resting-state fMRI and EEG connectivity data from 130 patients treated with sertraline and 135 patients with placebo from the Establishing Moderators and Biosignatures of Antidepressant Response in Clinical Care (EMBARC) study. A deep learning framework was developed using graph neural networks to integrate data-augmented connectivity and cross-modality correlation, aiming to predict individual symptom changes by revealing multimodal brain network signatures. The results showed that our model demonstrated promising prediction accuracy, with an R^2 value of 0.24 for sertraline and 0.20 for placebo. It also exhibited potential in transferring predictions using only EEG. Key brain regions identified for predicting sertraline response included the inferior temporal gyrus (fMRI) and posterior cingulate cortex (EEG), while for placebo response, the precuneus (fMRI) and supplementary motor area (EEG) were critical. Additionally, both modalities identified the superior temporal gyrus and posterior cingulate cortex as significant for sertraline response, while the anterior cingulate cortex and postcentral gyrus were common predictors in the placebo arm. Additionally, variations in the frontoparietal control, ventral attention, dorsal attention, and limbic networks were notably associated with MDD treatment. By integrating fMRI and EEG, our study established novel multimodal brain network signatures to predict individual responses to sertraline and placebo in MDD, providing interpretable neural circuit patterns that may guide future targeted interventions.

We highlight the bidirectional nature of trust, in which both patients and providers must trust AI systems, while these systems rely on the quality of human input to function effectively. Using models of care-seeking behavior, we explore the potential of AI to affect patients’ decisions to seek care, influence trust in healthcare providers and institutions, and affect diverse demographic and clinical settings.

         "Background, Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (SICH) is a devastating condition that significantly contributes to high mortality rates. This study aims to construct a mortality prediction model for patients with SICH using four various artificial intelligence (AI) machine learning algorithms., Method, A retrospective analysis was conducted on electronic medical records of SICH patients aged 20 and above, admitted to Chi Mei Medical Center’s intensive care unit between January 2016 and December 2021. The study utilized 37 features related to mortality. Predictive models were developed using logistic regression, Random forest, LightGBM, XGBoost, and Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), with assessments of feature importance, and Area under the curve (AUC)., Results, A total of 1451 SICH patients were enrolled. Factors associated with mortality included lower initial GCS scores ( p  < 0.001), pupillary changes ( P  < 0.001), kidney disease ( p  < 0.001), and respiratory failure requiring intubation ( p  < 0.001). Negative correlations were observed between mortality and pupil light reflexes, as well as GCS components E( r =-0.4602), V ( r =-0.4132), M( r =-0.4082). Positive correlations were identified with vasopressors ( r  = 0.4464), FiO2 ( r  = 0.3901), and sedative-hypnotic drugs ( r  = 0.1178). XGBoost demonstrated the best predictive performance (AUC = 0.913), outperforming LR (0.899), RF (0.905), LightGBM (0.909), and MLP (0.892). The XGBoost model, utilizing both 18 and 36 features, continues to outperform both the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) ( p  < 0.001) and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scoring systems ( p  < 0.001)., Conclusion, This study successfully developed an AI mortality prediction model for SICH patients, with XGBoost exhibiting superior performance. The model, incorporating 18 key features, has been integrated into clinical practice assisting clinicians in treatment decisions and communication with patients’ families.",

         "Background, Monkeypox, a viral zoonotic disease, is an emerging global health concern, with rising incidence and outbreaks extending beyond its endemic regions in Central and, West Africa and the world. The disease transmits through contact with infected animals and humans, leading to fever, rash, and lymphadenopathy symptoms. Control efforts include surveillance, contact tracing, and vaccination campaigns; however, the increasing number of cases underscores the necessity for a coordinated global response to mitigate its impact. Since monkeypox has become a public health issue, new methods for efficiently identifying cases are required. The control of monkeypox infections depends on early detection and prediction. This study aimed to utilize Symptom-Based Detection of Monkeypox using a machine-learning approach., Methods, This research presents a machine learning approach that integrates various Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to enhance the detection of monkeypox cases based on clinical symptoms, addressing the limitations of image-based diagnostic systems. In this study, we used a publicly available dataset from GitHub containing clinical features about monkeypox disease. The data have been analysed using Random Forest, Bagging, Gradient Boosting, CatBoost, XGBoost, and LGBMClassifier to develop a robust predictive model., Results, The study shows that machine learning models can accurately diagnose monkeypox based on symptoms like fever, rash, lymphadenopathy and other clinical symptoms. By using XAI techniques for feature importance, the approach not only achieved high accuracy but also provided transparency in decision-making. This integration of explainable Artificial intelligence (AI) enhances trust and allows healthcare professionals to understand predictions, leading to timely interventions and improved public health responses to monkeypox outbreaks. All Machine learning methods have been compared with the evaluation matrix. The best performance was for the LGBMClassifier, with an accuracy of 89.3%. In addition, multiple Explainable Techniques tools were used to help in examining and explaining the output of the LGBMClassifier model., Conclusions, Our research shows that combining explainable techniques with AI models greatly enhances the accuracy of case detection and boosts the trust of medical professionals. These models result in directly involving the reader and health care professional in the decision-making process, making informed decisions, and efficiently allocating resources by providing insight into the decision-making process.

The models were comparatively evaluated on a smaller annotated dataset of Covid-19 vaccine-related tweets prior to the longitudinal analysis.

AFINN analysis revealed that 51.38% of the 44,130 tweets were neutral, while 38.84% were positive, and 9.78% negative. Latent Dirichlet Allocation was used for topic modeling at the peak points corresponding to large sentiment fluctuations in the positive and negative longitudinal graphs derived using AFINN. The positive and negative vocabularies at peak points were scrutinized to derive insights on national/international events that triggered a change in public opinion. These findings could guide policy makers in gathering intelligence on misinformation and associated sentiments, and planning counter-measures to combat anti-vaccine campaigns.

         "In this study, different machine learning algorithms were analysed to predict casting defects in a cold chamber magnesium high-pressure die casting process. Based on component-related process and quality data from 7982 casting cycles, models were trained using Support Vector Machine, Random Forest and AutoML algorithms from Auto-Sklearn. The aim was to predict the presence of defect classes (\"cold flow\", \"shrinkage cavity\", \"blister\", \"soldering point\", \"scrap\"). Random Forest models achieved the best prediction quality overall, especially for the defect class \"soldering points\", which is the least frequent detected defect. An analysis of training data amounts showed that the prediction quality only improves slightly beyond 1000 training cycles, except for the \"soldering point\" defect class, which showed further improvements with more training data. Furthermore, the scope of data in terms of measurement sources affected the prediction quality significantly. Random Forest prediction models that were trained exclusively with casting machine data generally provide a solid basis for predicting casting defects. The highest increase in prediction performance was achieved by adding die sensor data. Overall, the prediction quality of all models was always above the statistically expected values (Balanced Accuracy of 50%), and soldering points in particular were predicted with a Balanced Accuracy of more than 80%. It was found that block temperature sensors in the shot sleeve and force measurements (for measuring the cavity pressure via the ejector pin) had comparatively high correlations with all defect classes and were weighted highly by the Random Forest models for decision-making.",

         "data-driven prediction of casting defects in magnesium high-pressure die casting using machine learning. in this study, different machine learning algorithms were analysed to predict casting defects in a cold chamber magnesium high-pressure die casting process. based on component-related process and quality data from 7982 casting cycles, models were trained using support vector machine, random forest and automl algorithms from auto-sklearn. the aim was to predict the presence of defect classes (\"cold flow\", \"shrinkage cavity\", \"blister\", \"soldering point\", \"scrap\"). random forest models achieved the best prediction quality overall, especially for the defect class \"soldering points\", which is the least frequent detected defect. an analysis of training data amounts showed that the prediction quality only improves slightly beyond 1000 training cycles, except for the \"soldering point\" defect class, which showed further improvements with more training data. furthermore, the scope of data in terms of measurement sources affected the prediction quality significantly. random forest prediction models that were trained exclusively with casting machine data generally provide a solid basis for predicting casting defects. the highest increase in prediction performance was achieved by adding die sensor data. overall, the prediction quality of all models was always above the statistically expected values (balanced accuracy of 50%), and soldering points in particular were predicted with a balanced accuracy of more than 80%. it was found that block temperature sensors in the shot sleeve and force measurements (for measuring the cavity pressure via the ejector pin) had comparatively high correlations with all defect classes and were weighted highly by the random forest models for decision-making.",

         "The presence of pre-existing or acquired drug-resistant cells within the tumor often leads to tumor relapse and metastasis. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables elucidation of the subtle differences in drug responsiveness among distinct cell subpopulations within tumors. A few methods have employed scRNA-seq data to predict the drug response of individual cells to date, but their performance is far from satisfactory. In this study, we propose SSDA4Drug, a semi-supervised few-shot transfer learning method for inferring drug-resistant cancer cells. SSDA4Drug extracts pharmacogenomic features from both bulk and single-cell transcriptomic data using semi-supervised adversarial domain adaptation. This allows us to transfer knowledge of drug sensitivity from bulk-level cell lines to single cells. We conduct extensive performance evaluation experiments across multiple independent scRNA-seq datasets, demonstrating SSDA4Drug’s superior performance over current state-of-the-art methods. Remarkably, with only one or two labeled target-domain samples, SSDA4Drug significantly boosts the predictive performance of single-cell drug responses. Moreover, SSDA4Drug accurately recapitulates the temporally dynamic changes of drug responses during continuous drug exposure of tumor cells, and successfully identifies reversible drug-responsive states in lung cancer cells, which initially acquire resistance through drug exposure but later restore sensitivity during drug holidays. Also, our predicted drug responses consistently align with the developmental patterns of drug sensitivity observed along the evolutionary trajectory of oral squamous cell carcinoma cells. In addition, our derived SHAP values and integrated gradients effectively pinpoint the key genes involved in drug resistance in prostate cancer cells. These findings highlight the exceptional performance of our method in determining single-cell drug responses. This powerful tool holds the potential for identifying drug-resistant tumor cell subpopulations, paving the way for advancements in precision medicine and novel drug development.",

However, recent studies have revealed a heightened vulnerability of medical DNNs to adversarial attacks compared to their natural counterparts. In this work, we present a novel perspective by analyzing the disparities between medical datasets and natural datasets, specifically focusing on the dataset collection process. Our analysis uncovers unique differences in the data distribution across different image classes in medical datasets, a phenomenon absent in natural datasets. To gain deeper insights into medical datasets, we employ Fourier analysis tools to investigate medical DNNs. Intriguingly, we discover that high-frequency components in medical images exhibit stronger associations with corresponding labels compared to those in natural datasets. These high-frequency components distract the attention of medical DNNs, rendering them more susceptible to adversarial images. To mitigate this vulnerability, we propose a preprocessing technique called Removing High-frequency Components (RH) training. Our experimental results demonstrate that the application of RH training significantly enhances the robustness of medical DNNs against adversarial attacks. Notably, in certain scenarios, RH training even outperforms traditional adversarial training methods, particularly when subjected to black-box attacks.",

We report a novel unified approach to predict and infer chemical compounds with the desired AS based on simple deterministic graph-theoretic descriptors, multiple linear regression (MLR), and mixed integer linear programming (MILP). Selected descriptors based on a forward stepwise procedure enabled the simplest regression model, MLR, to achieve significantly good prediction accuracy compared to the existing approaches, achieving accuracy in the range [0.7191, 0.9377] for 29 diverse datasets. By simulating these descriptors and learning models as MILPs, we inferred mathematically exact and optimal compounds with the desired AS, prescribed structures, and up to 50 non-hydrogen atoms in a reasonable time range [6, 1166] seconds. These findings indicate a strong correlation between the simple graph-theoretic descriptors and the AS of compounds, potentially leading to a deeper understanding of their AS without relying on widely used complicated chemical descriptors and complex machine learning models that are computationally expensive, and therefore difficult to use for inference.

         "a unified approach to inferring chemical compounds with the desired aqueous solubility. aqueous solubility (as) is a key physiochemical property that plays a crucial role in drug discovery and material design. we report a novel unified approach to predict and infer chemical compounds with the desired as based on simple deterministic graph-theoretic descriptors, multiple linear regression (mlr), and mixed integer linear programming (milp). selected descriptors based on a forward stepwise procedure enabled the simplest regression model, mlr, to achieve significantly good prediction accuracy compared to the existing approaches, achieving accuracy in the range [0.7191, 0.9377] for 29 diverse datasets. by simulating these descriptors and learning models as milps, we inferred mathematically exact and optimal compounds with the desired as, prescribed structures, and up to 50 non-hydrogen atoms in a reasonable time range [6, 1166] seconds. these findings indicate a strong correlation between the simple graph-theoretic descriptors and the as of compounds, potentially leading to a deeper understanding of their as without relying on widely used complicated chemical descriptors and complex machine learning models that are computationally expensive, and therefore difficult to use for inference. an implementation of the proposed approach is available at  https://github.com/ku-dml/mol-infer/tree/master/aqsol .",

Our algorithm identified 15 TPN formulas that can enable a precision-medicine approach (Pearson’s R  = 0.94 compared to experts), increasing safety and potentially reducing cost. A blinded study ( n  = 192) revealed that physicians rated TPN2.0 higher than current best practice. In patients with high disagreement between the actual prescriptions and TPN2.0, standard prescriptions were associated with increased morbidities (for example, odds ratio = 3.33; P  value = 0.0007 for necrotizing enterocolitis), while TPN2.0 recommendations were linked to reduced risk.

This study presents a novel, non-invasive tumor detection technique that integrates finite element analysis (FEA) with machine learning (ML) models. A piezoelectric sensor, developed using vibration absorber phenomena, was designed to detect changes in tissue stiffness caused by tumors. The sensor's interaction with soft tissue of varying Young’s modulus (9 to 185 kPa) was simulated to mimic the properties of cancerous tissue. Modal and harmonic analyses using ANSYS software, including indentation trials, were conducted to study the sensor’s response to stiffness variations, creating a dataset based on tumor sizes (5, 10, 12, 15, 17, 20, and 25 mm in diameter) at different vertical and horizontal distances from the tissue surface to the tumor center, simulating various growth stages and depths. The collected data were used to train two machine learning models: a recurrent neural network (RNN) for precise tumor localization and sizing and a feedforward neural network (FNN) to estimate tissue stiffness through sensor absorber frequencies. The proposed methodology demonstrated promising results, with a minimum error of 0.04 mm in tumor size estimation and 0.0319 kPa in stiffness detection. This approach offers potential improvements in early tumor detection by providing accurate and noninvasive diagnostics, particularly in resource-constrained environments.",

This paper investigates the role of multidimensional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures: 1D-CNN, 2D-CNN and 3D-CNN, using the DWT subbands of sMRI data. 1D-CNN involves energy features extracted from the CD subband of sMRI data.

In the case of 3D-CNNs, the CV subband is used which leads to volumetric feature extraction from vertical high frequency coefficients. Feature extraction in DWT domain explores textural changes, edges, coarse and fine details present in sMRI data from which the multidimensional feature extraction is carried out for classification.Through maximum voting technique, the proposed model optimizes schizophrenia classification from the multidimensional CNN models. The generalization of the proposed model for the two datasets proves convincing in improving the classification accuracy.

The results of random forest model showed that these 5 m6A regulators exhibited diagnostic potential and were characteristic genes of POAG. All POAG samples could be effectively divided into two groups based on the expression levels of these 5 hub m6A regulators. Immune cell infiltration analysis indicated that the levels of activated CD8^+ T cells and regulatory T cells were different in the two subtypes. HTMC oxidative stress cell model and TGF-β2 stimulation cell model were further constructed to verify the expression of the aforementioned hub m6A regulators, and it was found that YTHDC2 mRNA showed the same expression trend in both models. The silencing of YTHDC2 enhanced the migration ability of HTMCs and increased the synthesis ability of ECM. However, when YTHDC2^ΔYTH, which lacks the YTH domain, is overexpressed in HTMCs, there is no significant change in the ECM synthesis ability., Conclusions, The differentially expressed m6A regulators in TM tissues may serve as potential diagnostic biomarkers for POAG.

Traditional experimental methods for identifying protein-binding peptides are costly and time-consuming. Current sequence-based approaches often struggle with accuracy, focusing too narrowly on proximal sequence features and ignoring structural data. This study presents Deep-ProBind, a powerful prediction model designed to classify protein binding sites by integrating sequence and structural information.

The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) algorithm selects the optimal hybrid features, and a Deep Neural Network (DNN) is then used as the classification algorithm to predict protein-binding peptides. The performance of the proposed model was evaluated in comparison with traditional Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and existing models. Experimental results demonstrate that Deep-ProBind achieved 92.67% accuracy with tenfold cross-validation on benchmark datasets and 93.62% accuracy on independent samples. The Deep-ProBind outperforms existing models by 3.57% on training data and 1.52% on independent tests.
